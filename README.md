### Hi there 😃👋

#### I'm Amin — nice to meet you!

I’m an **AI Engineer at [TogetherCrew](https://github.com/togetherCrew/)**, where I build data pipelines and LLM-powered systems to support decentralized online communities.

---

### 💼 What I Work On

* Designing **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems using `llama-index`, with persistent caching, data deduplication, and relevance-based embedding logic.
* Creating **ETL pipelines** that handle large-scale community data across multiple platforms using `Apache Airflow` and `Temporal`. I implement optimizations like indexing only the latest data and deduplicating via hash comparison.
* Evaluating LLM outputs with custom **RAG evaluation metrics** including *coverage*, *relevance*, and *confidence scoring*.
* Developing **LLM agents** using `LangChain` and `CrewAI` for orchestrated multi-agent tasks.
* Continuously improving data quality and pipeline efficiency by investigating upstream community behavior data and pushing for tighter integration across microservices.

### 🧠 Projects

#### 🔹 [Hivemind-Bot](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/hivemind-bot) — RAG System, LLM

Message-driven system that performs retrieval over embedded organizational data to generate LLM-based responses. Communicates with other services via broker queues.

#### 🔹 [Hivemind-ETL](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/) — ETL, Caching

ETL DAGs using `Apache Airflow` for data embedding and summarization. Includes **caching mechanisms** to avoid redundant embeddings and **indexing strategies** based on timestamped persistence.

#### 🔹 [Temporal Worker](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/temporal-worker-python) — Workflow Orchestration & Data Processing
Implemented scalable, fault-tolerant workflows using Temporal for orchestrating asynchronous data processing tasks. Features include data deduplication via hashing, ETL orchestration, message brokering, and seamless integration with microservices for real-time event-driven pipelines.

#### 🔹 [Violation Detection](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/) — LLM Classification

Fine-tuned a custom LLM to detect community violations in messages. Built pipelines for classification and automated reporting.

#### 🔹 [Agents Workflow](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/agents-workflow) — CrewAI, LangChain

Developed multi-agent LLM apps using `CrewAI` and `LangChain`, focused on community data analysis and dynamic decision-making tasks.

#### 🔹 [TC-Analyzer](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/tc_analyzer_lib) — Analytics Library

Python library for behavioral analytics on community members. Features graph analytics and activity-based segmentation.
