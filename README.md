### Projects Highlights

#### Hivemind-Bot â€” LLM
Developed a RAG pipeline that ingests data from various platforms and generates responses based on the data. Listened on a message broker to receive messages, performed RAG operations on the data, and sent the responses to another microservice via the broker. [Link to codes](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/hivemind-bot)

#### Hivemind-ETL â€” Data Pipeline, LLM
A set of ETL scripts to embed raw data For RAG pipeline. The scripts were written on Apache Airflow service and they included both raw data processing and summary data. [Link to codes](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/)

#### Platform Data Transformation â€” Data Pipeline
Multiple sets of ETL scripts written as Apache Airflow DAGs to transform any platform data to a general data structure that could be used for many tasks such as Analytics, Text Classification, and Embedding ETLs. [Link to codes](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/)

#### Violation Detection â€” Data Pipeline, LLM
Fine-tuned a Large Language Model (LLM) to classify text messages for detecting violations. Developed pipelines to prompt the fine-tuned model for message labeling and to fire violation reports to another microservice via a broker. [Link to codes](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/)

#### TC-Analyzer â€” Data Pipeline, Python Library
Developed a Python library for custom analytics on data from various platforms. The library categorized members based on their community activity and performed graph analytics. [Link to codes](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/tc_analyzer_lib)
