### 🧠 Project Highlights

#### 🔹 [Hivemind-Bot](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/hivemind-bot) — LLM, RAG Pipeline

Built a message-driven RAG system that ingests data from multiple platforms, generates context-aware responses, and routes results via microservices.

#### 🔹 [Hivemind-ETL](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/) — ETL, Apache Airflow

Created ETL scripts to embed and summarize raw data for the RAG pipeline. Implemented on Apache Airflow to automate both data preparation and transformation.

#### 🔹 [Platform Data Transformation](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/) — ETL, Analytics

Developed general-purpose Airflow DAGs to transform platform-specific data into a unified structure for analytics, classification, and embedding tasks.

#### 🔹 [Violation Detection](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/airflow-dags/) — LLM, Text Classification

Fine-tuned an LLM to detect policy violations in text messages. Built pipelines for classification and alert routing through message brokers.

#### 🔹 [TC-Analyzer Library](https://github.com/TogetherCrew/tc_analyzer_lib) — Python, Analytics

Designed a Python library to analyze community behavior, classify user roles, and perform graph analytics on multi-platform data.
