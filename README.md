#### I'm Mohammad Amin and currently I am learning Computer Engineering with the field of Artificial Intelligence Master's degree at Isfahan University.
At the time I'm working on perturbation-based Explainable AI methods for my master's degree thesis. Also I'm learning new technologies in data engineering to prepare myself for available jobs. <br> With the help of my university colleagues, I've created a group named Cassandra AI that aims to share people's knowledge about AI staff. To visit our website: https://cass-ai.github.io/ (we've done two phase of article reading each with 5 meetings, and at the time, we're mostly occupied with other projects but planning for new amazing staff for it)
<!-- Also I have two course in this semester written below:
- Evolutionary Computing
- Speech Processing -->

***
##### My past highlighted project topics are:
- *explanations on xray images*: https://github.com/amindadgar/xray-image-explanations
- *Adversarial Attacks*: Adversarial attacks using image filters on DenseNet121 model (transfer learning was done). [adversarial-attacks-on-image-filters](https://github.com/amindadgar/adversarial-attacks-using-image-filters)
- *Evolutionary Computing*: Optimizing different problems such as Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Multi-Objective VRP using Evolutionary Strategies. [implementation-of-exercises](https://github.com/amindadgar/Evolutionary-Computing)
- *Machine Learning*: Analysing the dependency of fold accuracy and variances by re-implementing the article https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8012491 as part of Machine-Learning Final Project course. codes: [K-Fold-CV-Analysis](https://amindadgar.github.io/Dependency-Analysis-KFoldCrossValidation/)
- *Fuzzy Systems*: Implement different methods of fuzzy systems from scratch in the its course exercise: [Fuzzy Systems](https://github.com/amindadgar/Fuzzy-Systems)
- *Neural Networks*: Building an object detection Face Mask detection model, Using TensorFlow Object detection API.
- *Pattern Recognition*: deploying Some types of Support Vector Machines model. (Medium Article Link: [various types of SVMs](https://amindadgar.medium.com/various-types-of-support-vector-machines-in-machine-learning-3a09ca465850), Codes are not public)
- *Bachelor's Project*: Building a cloth classifier deep neural networks model using Keras API. (Codes are not publicly available)
- *Alexy Grigorev Zoomcamp midterm*: Diabeties prediction System ([Diabeties Prediction System](https://github.com/amindadgar/MLZoomcamp-MidTerm-Project)) 

#### Teck Stacks
The tecknologies that I'm familiar with:
- Python
- SQL, Neo4j
  - And worked a bit with mongoDB database
- Flask 
  - Done some minimal projects with it, but it's really easy for me to learn more.
- Latex
- Git


Also I've worked in the past with the technologies below:
- Node Js
- Node Red
- Programming arduino boards such as ESP8266
- Android programming with Kotlin
