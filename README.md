#### I'm Mohammad Amin and currently I am learning Computer Engineering with the field of Artificial Intelligence Masters degree at Isfahan University.
At the time I'm researching in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence to finalize my thesis topic. <br> 

***
##### My past highlighted project topics are:
- *Machine Learning*: Analysing the results for K-Fold cross validation method. [K-Fold-CV-Analysis](https://amindadgar.github.io/Dependency-Analysis-KFoldCrossValidation/)
- *Fuzzy Systems*: Implement different methods of fuzzy systems from scratch in the its course exercise: [Fuzzy Systems](https://github.com/amindadgar/Fuzzy-Systems)
- *K-Fold Cross Validation Analysis*: Analysing the dependency of fold accuracy and variances by re-implementing the article https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8012491 as part of Machine-Learning Final Project course
- *Neural Networks*: Building an object detection Face Mask detection model, Using TensorFlow Object detection API.
- *Pattern Recognition*: deploying Some types of Support Vector Machines model. (Medium Article Link: [various types of SVMs](https://amindadgar.medium.com/various-types-of-support-vector-machines-in-machine-learning-3a09ca465850), Codes are not public)
- *Bachelor's Project*: Building a cloth classifier deep neural networks model using Keras API. (Codes are not publicly available)
- *Alexy Grigorev Zoomcamp midterm*: Diabeties prediction System ([Diabeties Prediction System](https://github.com/amindadgar/MLZoomcamp-MidTerm-Project))
